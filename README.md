# ZalesForce
A Salesforce parody, but make it better with less hassle. While working at Commonfund Capital, many employees complained about the annoyances SalesForce brings, such
as how complicated it is to use and how there are only a limited amount of IT architects to handle requests at a time. To alleviate the IT team, I decided to step in
to give the good 'ole SalesForce 2.0 a try. Meet ZalesForce - SalesForce that is better, smarter, and quicker with a zing. The first request is a centralized
platform for greater efficiency and effectiveness for asset mamagement and alternative investment workers.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** Node.js, JavaScript, CSS

Zalesforce is the beginning to my node.js journey and I would not have it any other way. The scrapiness and hunger I possess for a working model can only
continue with the interactive elements of being able to new interactions, fill out forms, and have demo usability. The node.js is a choice I made out to 
challenge myself by being thorough with my quest to learn JavaScript in all its flavors.

## Optimizations

I was not able to use angular and make these changes initially, for this demo represents my original reach out to the IT department. I was inspired by SalesForce's
general layout for how it is currently, but in a mockable version. Future versions ae holisitcally seamless by being unable to tell the angular version to the version
I am creating. There are versions where there are elements missing up until the current version.

## Lessons Learned:

As an engineer, I am in the trough of sorrow by doubting my abilities. The ZalesForce project is an example of hope for me to continue to make progress towards
a viable service. There are moments where I must remind myself that I know enough, that I am skilled enough. All of my career and academic experience led me 
up to this point... Everything that occurred in the past is a sentimental motivation to think more logically and to step as an improved engineer.
